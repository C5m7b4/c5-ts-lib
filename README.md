This is my attempt at a typescript library aimed at helping make peoples lives a little easier when coding. Here are the components that are currently offered.

- [isValid](#isvalid)
- [pad](#pad)

## isValid

This function can be used to validate that a string or a number or date or array or even an object can be used. This is your failsafe function.

## pad

This function will either left or right pad a string for you
